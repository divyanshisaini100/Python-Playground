# Swap Every Alternate Line and Reverse Odd Lines
Given multiple lines of input, modify the lines as follows:

    • Swap every two consecutive lines.

    • Reverse every odd-numbered line in the output sequence.

**NOTE:** This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.

*Input Format:*

    • The first line contains the integer n, the number of lines.

    • The next n lines contain text strings.

*Output Format:*

    • Print the transformed lines according to the rules specified.

**Example**

***For the input:***

5
apple
orange
pineapple
mango
kiwi

***The output should be:***

egnaro
apple
ognam
pineapple
iwik

**Explanation:**

    • The first and second lines are swapped, with the first line (orange) reversed.

    • The third and fourth lines are swapped, with the third line (mango) reversed.

    • The fifth line (kiwi), being alone, is reversed.
