# Pattern Print - N
Given an integer n (where n > 0), print an "N" shaped pattern with n rows. The pattern should have vertical bars (|) on the left and right sides of each row, with a backslash (\) moving diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right. There should be no spaces to the right of the pattern.

**NOTE:** This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.

***Input Format***

    • A single integer n, representing the number of rows in the pattern.

***Output Format***
