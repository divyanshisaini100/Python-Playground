# Replace middle with n times middle
Given a tuple t of odd length, and a positive integer n, replace the middle element with n copies of itself.

***NOTE***: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

***Examples***

* For t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and n = 5, the result should be (1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5).

* For t = (1, 2, 3) and n = 4, the result should be (1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3).
