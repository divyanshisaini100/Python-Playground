# Max Column sum and Max column sum index

Write a program to find the index of the column with the maximum sum of elements in a given **m x n** matrix. Find the 0-based index of the column that has the largest sum and the largest column sum.

If more than two columns have the same sum, the output should be the index of the first column (with the smallest index) among those with the maximum sum.

NOTE: This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.

***Input Format***

The first line contains two integers, m and n, the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
The next m lines each contain n space-separated integers representing the elements of the matrix.

***Output Format***

The first line has a integer, the index of the column with the maximum sum.
The second line has the maximum column sum.
