# Pattern Printing - W Pattern
Given an integer n (where n > 0), print an "W" shaped pattern with n rows.

The pattern should consist of a vertical bar (|) on the left and right sides of each row. Additionally, it should have forward slashes (/) and backslashes () moving diagonally towards each other from the top to the bottom.

**NOTE:** This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.

***Input Format***
