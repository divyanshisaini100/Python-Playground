# Total_image_size

we simply go thru a file (here data.txt) and it has listed filenames with diff extensions and sizes(in bits) in the form "2000,file1.png" where 2000 is the size of file1 in bits and ext is .png

Now we are given a set of extensions used for images which have to be counted in total_image_size and others (non-image files size has to be ignored)
