# Shopping List
Given a list of dictionaries with keys: name, quantity, and price for each item in a grocery list, write a function that does the following based on the request:

total_bill_amount: Find the total bill amount by summing the price multiplied by the quantity for each item.

max_quantity_item: Find the name of the item with the maximum quantity. If there are multiple items with the same quantity, return the first one.

sort_by_total_amount: Sort the list by the highest total amount for an item (calculated as price * quantity). If two items have the same total amount, break the tie by sorting by name in ascending order.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example

grocery_list = [
    {'name': 'apple', 'quantity': 2, 'price': 3},
    {'name': 'banana', 'quantity': 5, 'price': 2},
    {'name': 'carrot', 'quantity': 4, 'price': 1}
]
total_bill_amount -> 6+10+4 = 20
max_quantity_item -> 'banana'
sort_by_total_amount -> sorted list of dict in the order 'banana' , 'apple' and 'carrot'
