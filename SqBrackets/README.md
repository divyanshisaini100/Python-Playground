# Surround First Two and Last Two with Square Brackets
Given a string s, you need to surround the first two and the last two characters of the string with square brackets [].

Assume the string s will have at least 4 characters.

Example

"hello" -> "[he]l[lo]"
"python" -> "[py]th[on]"
"brackets" -> "[br]acke[ts]"
"four" -> "[fo][ur]"
