# Get Words That Come After "the"
Write a function to find all the words that immediately follow the word "the" in a given sentence. The search should be case-insensitive, and words are separated by spaces.


**Examples**

"The key and the lock is there" -> ['key', 'lock']
"The" (case-insensitive) is followed by "key" and "the" is followed by "lock" hence, the output is ['key', 'lock'].
"The the and the The" -> ['the', 'and', 'The']
"the" follows "The", "and" follows "the" and "The" follows "the".
