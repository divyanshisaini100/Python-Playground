# Print Pattern - X
Given an integer n (where n >= 0 ), print an "X" shaped pattern with n rows above and below a central character x. The pattern should use backslashes (\) and forward slashes (/) to form the "X" shape, with increasing spaces between them as they approach the center. There should be no spaces to the right of the pattern.

*NOTE: This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.*

**Input**

    • A single integer n, representing the number of rows above and below the center of the "X".

**Output**

    • An "X" shaped pattern with n rows above and below a central x character, as described.
